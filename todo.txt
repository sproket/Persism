Add a ResultSet class with similar interface to java.sql.ResultSet
but it would be read-only and disconnected and would not throw any SQLException
Add method in Query class for it. executeSQL or executeQuery.

maybe add our own ConstructorProperties annotation to remove dependency on java.beans.

maybe support transient keyword (works like @NotColumn) - doesn't work with records.
Records need javax.persistence.Transient or java.beans.Transient annotation. PITA
(we should not have any dependency on javax - only java) OR Add our own Annotation.
