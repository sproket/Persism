DONE we'll need synchronization of some kind - to make sure internal maps are written once.
    ConcurrentMap + private synchronized "determine" methods to do double check in the map.

Should we throw PINFException? Or just pass along SQLException...?

connection.getTypeMap()  // interesting - might be worth checking into.

persism! CHOSEN NOW MOVE ON.


Add a ResultSet class with similar interface to java.sql.ResultSet
but it would be read-only and disconnected and would not throw any SQLException
Add method in Query class for it. executeSQL or executeQuery.

ADD Firebird? Done.
Add Sybase DB2 Ingres Informix hsqldb? .....

TODO Handle X words Tax - Taxes, Fax - Faxes - plural rules

todo     @Column(name = "IsCompound") - yeah we do a simple "is" check but I need to think about this. See determinePropertyInfo
         private boolean compound; Find "Is" Columns so we don't need the annotation? OR just name the field isCompound - gets and sets seem to generate fine... BUT IT FAILS LOOKING FOR "compound" as the property name!


TODO DOCUMENTATION Example how to implement Persistable

TODO MAYBE https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser/releases/tag/jsqlparser-4.0

NOTE: Checks for setting for a default depend on an Object Type - will not work with primitive types.

DONE conversions between LocalDate and LocalDateTime (with downcast warning) (no warning though)

IN PROGRESS https://www.testcontainers.org/

Documentation: Remove "Persism" from Logo itself. Use separate Text instead.

https://andresalmiray.com/publishing-to-maven-central-using-apache-maven/

DONE Document date and time mapping and storing only up to the second for time.

Document about using CustomerOrder class for 2 different queries (1 stored proc). Problems arise if
you have 1 with a missing field that is 1st defined in MetaData (any query after - even if they are correct)
will complain about missing fields. You'd need to fix any query that would use that class (for now) - maybe
add the query string as a key to the Column/Property Info objects? Duplicating but......

DONE SQL enum to Java enum? PostgreSQL, MySQL and H2. TODO Possible with MSSQL with CHECK constraints

DONE @NotTable classes should allow getters only and we can set values through fields instead. (even normal table should allow this for read only columns)
DONE Add support for Records

MAVEN:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxP9IuJbcDQ
http://tutorials.jenkov.com/maven/publish-to-central-maven-repository.html

DONE add dual compile for 9+ with module-info.java - somewhere there's a tutorial for that ADDED Automatic-Module-Name


DONE test for con.setAutoCommit(false) and commit at appropriate times. how does this affect connection pools

DONE see https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/lvya1x/persism_101_released_a_zero_ceremony_orm_for_java/gpghfn4/

TODO money types add map to int or long in cents (future javax.money) (USELESS)

DONE Merges Logger changes and make the classes package private - check the size of the jar after

DONE Fix countable https://github.com/sproket/Persism/issues/5

TODO https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1736630/sql-constraint-minvalue-maxvalue - might be nice....
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Contacts]  WITH CHECK ADD CHECK  (([Status]>=(0) AND [Status]<=(10))) MSSSQL

DONE test overflowing all number types - should throw various runtime exceptions if they occur

DONE See about deprecating Column autoIncrement - I think all supported drivers detect this and even if you set it - why would it work? We won't get anything with getGeneratedKeys!

TODO Sample Oracle DB https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/doc.112/e26211/loe.htm

DONE Session autocommit false? https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/lvya1x/persism_101_released_a_zero_ceremony_orm_for_java/gpghfn4/

DONE POM still gets log4j logback and slf4j - FFS

// DONE org.apache.logging.log4j s/b log4j2 - no support for log4j1 but test BRIDGE 1.x
// If existing components use Log4j 1.x and you want to have this logging routed to Log4j 2, then remove any log4j 1.x dependencies and add the following.
// http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/maven-artifacts.html


TODO ORACLE INSERT with Generated UDDI https://www.techrepublic.com/article/oracle-tip-how-to-use-default-values-with-database-columns/

**Should we have @Optional for colulumn?** NO
Scenario:

I have a table where I may not want to select a column AND I have an associated
Record constructor. WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THIS? I would have to ignore for insert
and update then.
