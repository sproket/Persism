Add a ResultSet class with similar interface to java.sql.ResultSet
but it would be read-only and disconnected and would not throw any SQLException
Add method in Query class for it. executeSQL or executeQuery.

TODO Can we use https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/core-java-tutorial/java-9-changes/platform-logging.html to replace our logger? It doesn't seem so....

Maybe support https://github.com/ksuid/ksuid - not sure how or what we'd do.

TODO idea plugin - generate classes for Tables/Views (Views should be records) + code assist for property names with where() method

Could/should we support javax.persistence annotations? No. They don't make sense.

FIXED The incoming request has too many parameters. The server supports a maximum of 2100 parameters. SQL SERVER DOCUMENT THIS
This WAS a Persism Limitation on how I do joins. :)

DONE for 2.1 remove JTDS but ask on redddit and github

TODO Add handling for schema. When I have this I should include it in the SQL. select e.g. * from [dbo].[CustomerInvoice]

LOCAL DBS don't seem to return the multiple. Need to check each if they support and what separators to use
MSSSQL/PostgreSQL work with line feed and/or ";", Oracle NO, MySQL NO.

maybe add our own ConstructorProperties annotation to remove dependency on java.beans.

maybe support transient keyword (works like @NotColumn) - doesn't work with records.
Records need javax.persistence.Transient or java.beans.Transient annotation. PITA
(we should not have any dependency on javax - only java) OR Add our own Annotation.
