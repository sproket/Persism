# Solving the SELECT N+1 problem

Virtually all ORMs out there have mechanisms to support some kind of join or relationship where you 
have - let's say a Customer object which has a List of Invoice objects. Persism has not had anything
much to say about this - leaving it up to you to handle this situation on your own.

The reason for this mainly was I wanted to avoid the "impedance mismatch" problems inherent 
when you are combining OO/Procedural languages with SQL which is a declarative query language.

```java

public final class Customer {

    private String customerId;
    private String companyName;
    private Regions region;
    private String country;
    private Character status;

    private List<Invoice> invoices = new ArrayList<>();

    private Contact contact;
} 
```

So in the end, what do you think of my Solution?
