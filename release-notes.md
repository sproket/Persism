## Release Notes

### 1.1.0

* Added support for Records! (Java 16)
* Added preliminary support for Informix (looking for help to set up a vbox vm)
* Fixed UPDATE statement using columns in alphabetical order (All Persism generated SQL should be in column order)
* Fixed support for MSAccess with UCanAccess jdbc driver in Java 16
* Fixed issue with Queries cached with missing columns
* Fixed @Table name case sensitivity
* Added warnings if Persism doesn't have results when querying for DatabaseMetaData
* Added new constructor for Session to supply a fake URL for situations where the Connection metadata url returns null


### Breaking changes

* Insert now returns a typed Result object containing the rows changed and modified data object for cases when you insert a Record and there are defaults or autoincs to assign.


### 1.0.3

* Added support for MSAccess with UCanAccess jdbc driver (seems to be broken under Java 16 right now #13)
* Added new method withTransaction() to Session - simplifying multiple operations in a single database transaction
* Added automatic module name sproket.github.io.persism for 9+ support
* Added support for Log4j 2

### Breaking changes

* Property discovery now sees properties with getters only as possible columns (considered read-only columns). You will need to use the @NotColumn annotation to avoid the "<table/query> was not properly initialized." Runtime exception. (this was done for future support for Records)
* Persistable interface was changed. Renamed getOriginalValue method to readOriginalValue to avoid possible collision with read-only properties.


### 1.0.2

* Added detection of autoinc type for Oracle > 11 if using the form: "COLUMN_NAME" NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY
* Added tests and warning for byte type since it's not consistently represented in different databases

* Added AutoClosable implementation to Session
