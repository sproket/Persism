### 2.0.0

* Added SQL type wrapper for String
* Added Parameters type wrapper for parameters array
* Added better type safe query and fetch methods
* Added SQL where method (shorthand where Persism knows the columns) which supports property names as well as column names
* Added SQL proc method to indicate the query is a call to a stored proc rather than a SELECT statement
* Added support for named parameters

### 1.2.0
* Added support for Views
* Added query 'select *' method to session
* Finalized support for Informix (Tests added)
* Changed query statements to make explicit forward only and read only
* Improve readRecord performance
* Added BIT column to byte property conversion

### Breaking changes

* Update/Delete now also return a typed Result object containing the rows changed and modified data object.

### 1.1.0

* Added support for Records! (Java 16)
* Added preliminary support for Informix (looking for help to set up a vbox vm)
* Fixed UPDATE statement using columns in alphabetical order (All Persism generated SQL should be in column order)
* Fixed support for MSAccess with UCanAccess jdbc driver in Java 16
* Fixed issue with Queries cached with missing columns
* Fixed @Table name case sensitivity
* Added warnings if Persism doesn't have results when querying for DatabaseMetaData
* Added new constructor for Session to supply a fake URL for situations where the Connection metadata url returns null


### Breaking changes

* Insert now returns a typed Result object containing the rows changed and modified data object for cases when you insert a Record and there are defaults or autoincs to assign.


### 1.0.3

* Added support for MSAccess with UCanAccess jdbc driver (seems to be broken under Java 16 right now #13)
* Added new method withTransaction() to Session - simplifying multiple operations in a single database transaction
* Added automatic module name sproket.github.io.persism for 9+ support
* Added support for Log4j 2

### Breaking changes

* Property discovery now sees properties with getters only as possible columns (considered read-only columns). You will need to use the @NotColumn annotation to avoid the "<table/query> was not properly initialized." Runtime exception. (this was done for future support for Records)
* Persistable interface was changed. Renamed getOriginalValue method to readOriginalValue to avoid possible collision with read-only properties.
