Persism is a light weight, auto-discovery, auto-configuration, and convention over configuration ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for Java.
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-style: italic"> "Coding by convention, kind of like Apache Wicket... I guess it has its place, yes. jOOQ also does auto-mapping of column names. But not of table names. Nice thinking" </span>

## Simple

The API for Persism is small. Mostly you just need a Connection and a Persism Session object, and you're good to go.
Your POJOs can have optional annotations for table and column names and can optionally implement a Persistable interface
for where you need to track changes to properties for UPDATE statements.

## Auto-Discovery
Create a table, write a JavaBean, run a query. Persism uses simple mapping rules to
find your table and column names and only requires an annotation where
something is outside convention.

## Convention over configuration
Persism requires no special configuration. Drop the JAR into your project and go.

Persism has annotations though they are only needed where something is outside the conventions.
In many cases you probably don't even need them.

Persism can usually detect the table and column mappings for you including primary/generated
keys and columns with defaults.

Persism will do the correct thing by default. Persism understands that your class is called
"Customer" and your table is called "CUSTOMERS". It understands that your table column is
"CUSTOMER_ID" and your property is "customerId". Persism works fine even
when your class is called Category and your table is called CATEGORIES. No problem.
Persism uses annotations as a fall back – annotate only when something is outside the conventions.

## Tiny
Persism is about 100k and has *zero* dependencies however it will utilize logging based on whatever is available
at runtime - SLF4J, LOG4J2, LOG4J or JUL.
